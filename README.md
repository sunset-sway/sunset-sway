## About Sunset-sway Media Lab

Sunset-Sway is a media lab based in China. We focus on Play / Game (both analog and digital), working through research, translation, podcasting, art making, producing indie/experimental game works, workshops, teaching and publishing. We seek to make play/video games a medium of communication and intersection for things and area, connecting research and production with partners and organizations from different fields, cultures, and backgrounds to explore the ontology, meaning, and future potential of this new and rich medium.

落日间是一个聚焦于游玩与电子游戏的媒介实验室。我们通过研究，译介，播客，艺术创作，制作游戏作品，工作坊，教学和出版等方式工作，让游玩/电子游戏成为事物沟通交汇的媒介，连接研究与制作，与不同领域，文化，背景的伙伴和机构，共同探索这一具有丰富潜能的新事物的本体论，意义与未来的潜能。

## From Experimental Games to Artistic Commissions and Indie Games 从实验游戏到艺术委托创作与独立游戏

Sunset-sway started from the tradition of lightweight experimental and research-based video game and time-limited game development Game Jam Demo. With the construction of the team, we are now gradually advancing to a mature, commissioned and enriched local and on-site art creation method, and at the same time, we have built up a path to develop independent games for sale to the independent gamer market, utilizing the respective advantages of the art field's commissioning and exhibition production logic, and the internet distribution of these different channels.

落日间最早由轻量的实验性与研究型电子游戏创作与限时游戏开发 Game Jam 的传统起步。随着团队的建设，目前开始逐步地推进以成熟的，委任和丰富在地和现场性的艺术创作工作方式，并同时建起了面向独立游戏玩家市场售卖的独立游戏的开发道路，发挥艺术场域的委任与展览的制作逻辑与互联网分发这些不同渠道的各自优势。

## From Writing to Playable Essays / Co-writing, from Lectures to Lecture-performances 从写作到可玩的论文 / 共同写作，从讲座到讲座表演

Sunset-sway has been consistently working on original essays, including ontological reflections, research and creative summaries (music, literature, nothingness, philosophy, theater), and more experimental writing.

落日间一直在持续的进行原创文章的写作，包括本体论思考，研究和创作总结（音乐，文学，无，哲学，戏剧），和更多实验性写作等。

We're trying to practice the Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0 we translated, and are experimenting with experimental approaches to essay writing, as well as research and practice in traditions ranging from video essays to playable philosophical essays. In collaboration with the Shekou Theatre Festival, we are also thinking about and practicing the intertwining of humanities and thought with art, the resonance between thought and the senses, and exploring the realization of lecture-performance.

我们在尝试实践我们所翻译的数字人文宣言2.0，并且在尝试着实验性的论文写作的方式，以及从视频论文到可玩的哲学论文传统的研究和实践。在与蛇口戏剧节的合作与尝试探索之中，我们也在思索并且实践人文和思想与艺术的交织，思考与感官之间的共鸣，探索讲座表演的实现。

## From Teaching to Workshops 从教学到工作坊

Due to the recognition of our theoretical and practical work, Sunset has been collaborating with various universities in teaching and lecturing (including but not limited to the Game Design program at Communication University of China, IMDT at Tsinghua University, Fudan University's Liberal Studies Program, the Journalism Department at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, and the Visualization Department at Sichuan Fine Arts Institute, among others), as well as short-term courses for high school and even junior high school students. Recently we are also gradually exploring more workshop models that emphasize co-creation and interactivity, and plan to collaborate with different artists to play together.

由于相关的理论和实践工作得到认可，落日间长期与各方高校进行相关的合作授课和讲座教学（包括但不限于中国传媒大学的游戏设计专业，清华大学的IMDT，复旦大学通识课，上海财经大学新闻系，四川美术学院视觉等等），也包括面向高中生甚至初中生的短期课程。最近我们也在逐渐地进一步探索更多强调共同创作和互动性的工作坊模式，并且计划与不同的艺术家合作，一同游玩。

## From Podcasts to Communication 从播客到交流 

We use the conversation itself as an artistic project and historiographical record. Confronting the cultural dilemmas of video games in China, we are trying to construct transversal that cross parallel lines, to connect conversations between the internal and external worlds of gaming. Since 2021, we have produced nearly sixty podcasts, featuring conversations with philosophers, game developers, designers, architects, historians, editors, writers, scientists, poets, theater directors, and more. And around specific topics, we've initiated the Little Campfire of Game Studies focusing on young game researchers, and an interview series focusing on a new generation of artists who use games to create or think.

我们将交流本身作为一种综合的艺术计划和史学记录。面对电子游戏在中国的文化困境，构建起跨越平行线的贯线，连接起游戏内部和外部世界的对话。自2021年来，我们已制作了近六十期的播客内容，围绕游戏对话的嘉宾有哲学家，开发者，设计师，建筑师，历史学者，编辑，作家，科学家，诗人，戏剧导演等等。并围绕特定主题，我们开启了聚焦于青年游戏研究者的游戏研究小篝火，以及聚焦于新一代使用游戏进行创作与思考的艺术家系列的访谈计划 。

## From Translation to Publication 从译介到出版 

We launched an interdisciplinary open translation program around games in 2021, and have already translated and cited more than 120 articles and other articles in collaboration with people from various fields. It is also one of the most influential game studies content series in China, with content on game studies, game design, cybernetics, experimental games, contemporary art, etc., and some of the translations have been published in public journals and books.

我们在2021年发起了一个围绕游戏的跨学科开放翻译计划，目前已与各领域人士合作翻译并且引介了超过一百二十篇的文章等，也是中国影响力最大的游戏研究系列的内容计划之一，译介内容涉及游戏研究，游戏设计，控制论，实验游戏，当代艺术等，部分翻译已经发表在正式的刊物上。

We are collaborating with [SDX Joint Publishing Company,](https://en.cnpubg.com/portal/article/index/id/42/cid/4.html) a prestigious publisher in China, to bring international scholarly works on game studies to a wider audience. Our current portfolio includes notable titles such as "*Player vs. Monster: The Making and Breaking of Video Game Monstrosity*" and "*Handmade Pixels: Independent Video Games and the Quest for Authenticity*". Additionally, we are forging partnerships with a diverse group of entities in China that are dedicated to exploring the humanities aspects of gaming and pioneering in the field of experimental tabletop publishing. Our aim is to foster a more inclusive and vibrant discourse on gaming culture.

我们正在和国内著名的出版社三联书店合作引进海外的游戏人文研究的著作的出版工作，正在推进的书目包括：《Player vs. Monster: The Making and Breaking of Video Game Monstrosity》与《Handmade Pixels: Independent Video Games and the Quest for Authenticity》。我们同时也在广泛链接与国内聚焦于游戏人文，以及实验桌游出版的合作伙伴进行合作，推动更开放和丰富的游戏讨论环境。

## From Individual to Multitude, From Studio to Platform, From Position to Network 从个体到诸众，从工作室到平台，从阵地到网络

From a project initiated by an individual in his spare time at Tencent Games, Sunset has gradually become a group of studios with a wide range of different orientations, and we have intentionally used ourselves as a project, making ourselves the medium to connect and play with different actors, opening up to more friends to engage in in-depth co-creation of content with us, and becoming a network of people in motion together.

落日间从最早由个人在腾讯游戏公司业余时间所发起的计划，逐渐成为一个有着丰富不同面向的工作室团体，并且我们也有意地将自身作为项目，让自身成为媒介，与不同的行动者连结并且共同游玩，开放更多朋友与我们进行深度的内容共创，成为一个共同运动着的网络。

**Game Studies Camp** **游戏研究营地 GSC**

Game Studies Camp is a game study academic camp supported by sunset-sway, trying to gather young game researchers to act together outside the academy. Our current base members are masters and doctoral graduates from Peking University, Tsinghua University, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and other universities at home and abroad, with different backgrounds, such as cultural studies, philosophy of art, literature, history, museography, etc. We are running a camp in the name of **Game Study Camp**, to connect and play with different actors, and open up more friends to create deep content together as a movement network. In the name of the camp, we are conducting academic writing and inviting scholars from home and abroad for academic sharing and exchange.

游戏研究营地是由落日间支持发起的游戏研究学术阵地，试图汇聚青年的游戏研究者，来共同在学院之外行动，我们目前的基础成员由来自北京大学，清华大学，香港中文大学等海内外院校的，来自文化研究，艺术哲学，文艺学，历史学，博物馆学等等不同背景的硕士，博士毕业生等。我们正在以营地为名，进行学术写作和邀请海内外学者进行学术分享交流等活动。

**x indienova "makegames" content cooperation program**

sunset-sway is working with [indienova.com](https://indienova.com/) on a content program called "makegames", in the hope of providing the Chinese-speaking world with an entry point to think deeply about indie game culture and development. We believe that understanding the creators and backgrounds of games, and exploring more diverse, under-appreciated, and even experimental indie games, will help us to savor, explore, and reflect on games from more diverse perspectives; we also believe that game development and creation should be demystified into a topic that is more accessible to the general public, so that all those who are touched can better understand and participate in the future development of video games.

落日间正在与 [indienova.com](https://indienova.com/) 共同推进名为“做游戏”的内容计划，希望为中文世界拓宽深入思考独立游戏文化与开发的入口。我们相信，了解游戏的创作者与创作背景，探索更多样、未受到广泛关注，乃至实验性的独立游戏，有助于我们从更加多元的视角品味、探究游戏，并进行反思；我们也相信，游戏的开发与创作应该被祛魅为更易被大众认知的话题，让所有被触及者更好地理解并参与到电子游戏的未来发展中。（https://xpaidia.com/makegames/）
